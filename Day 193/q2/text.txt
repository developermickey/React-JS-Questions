Q2. LLD-React_Product_Filter

Problem Statement Build a dynamic product filter application using React. This application will allow users to filter a list of products by category without any server or API calls, demonstrating handling of state and rendering based on user input.

Requirements:

1. Display a list of products. Each product has a name, price, and category.
2. Provide a set of checkboxes that allow users to select which categories to view.
3. The product list should update in real-time as users check/uncheck categories.
4. No use of external APIs; all data should be handled within the app's state
