Q1. LLD-React_PureComponent_Counter

Problem Statement:
You are tasked with creating a pure component in React that displays a simple counter. The component should increment the counter value by 1 every time the user clicks on a button. However, there's a catch: the component must be pure, meaning it should not mutate its state directly but instead return a new state object whenever a change occurs.
